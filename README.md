# Chat-WS-Server

Basic working MVP for WebSocket communications. It handles Chat just fine, but, as of right now, is still handling socket state and lacks a error fallbacks and handling. 

It is a NAIVE implementation, but the point was to quickly blueprint a stable, scalable baseline to work with while engineering, designing, and developing the entire Frontend/API Server/ DB.

There is going to be future integrations with WebRTC and Redis-- perhaps another Mesage Broker-- for scalability, so there's going to be a lot of breaking changes in the future.

This server was built with NodeJS using [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) for the WebSocket implementation and [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for http routing. My reasons for using both are simple-- both are lightweight, fast, battle tested with minimal abstractions.
